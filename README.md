## Assignment Description:
For this project we implemented Locality-constrained Linear Coding (LLC) image classification method and applied it to a specific dataset of natural scene images. LLC coding improves upon the Vector Quantization (VQ) coding method by preserving a feature's spatial context.

## Features:
This is a brief description of our implementation. More details can be found in the other pages of the wiki.

### Basic Features:
* Modified the basic spatial pyramid to use Locality-constrained Linear Coding (LLC) with max pooling.
* Evaluated LLC against VQ
* Tuned parameters for codebook size and k nearest neighbors to maximize accuracy.

### "Bonus" Features:
* Combined LLC with Object Bank to improve accuracy
* Implemented codebook optimization (algorithm 4.1 in the paper)
* Implemented K-means++ to select K-means initial centers more intelligently
* Built a GUI to easily run our pipeline

## Best Result:
Our best results came from **combining LLC and object bank by summing up decision values**. The classification accuracy with this technique is **81.34%**. The averaged class accuracy for all classes is **80.65%**.
