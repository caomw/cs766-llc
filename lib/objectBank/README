In code folder, you will find part and partless.

part code is the original code we used in ECCV to produce the result. partless code is available to speed up the feature extraction while maintaining even higher classification result.

feature extraction using partless code takes approximately 7 seconds per image.

get_traintestfeat.m and run_classification.m are helper functions we used to produce the result; in order to use it, LIBSVM needs to be successfully compiled first and appropriate configuration should replace {} within the code.
